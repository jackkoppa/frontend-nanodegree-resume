# Project Details
## Background
An assignment for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. Forked from the [Udacity repo](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume). Project rubric available [here](https://review.udacity.com/?_ga=1.189245867.12280332.1465333852#!/projects/2962818615/rubric).

## Usage
In order to allow for future modular usage of resume data, the biographical JSON has been broken out into a separate repo. In order to view this project, please navigate to the project root, and run

`git clone`

on the [resume-data repo](https://github.com/jackkoppa/resume-data).

In the future, I would like to automate this by including `resume-data` as an npm package, since I'll be using it for other portfolio/resume/bio-type projects.
